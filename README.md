## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Preventative mental healthcare is critical, yet current methods relying solely on self-reported symptoms can be inaccurate and delayed.  
Mindscape tackles this problem by integrating wearable biometric data, using machine learning models to detect outliers indicative of potential mental health concerns.

The system consists of:
- A user-friendly **mobile application** (React Native) connected to Apple Health.
- A **Splunk-hosted dashboard** analyzing collected biometric data for early warning signs.

Mindscape empowers users to better manage their mental well-being with personalized, secure, and insightful health tracking.
